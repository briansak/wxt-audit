Checks Webex Teams rooms looking for individuals registered with generic email services.

This simple script will check your Webex Teams space looking for generic email domains such as gmail.com, hotmail.com, or yahoo.com and will remove them from the room automatically.  This is used to enforce room policies that require that you join with accounts associated with specific email domains or do not allow for generic accounts.
